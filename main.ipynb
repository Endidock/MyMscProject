      "So, when you ask what the two illnesses are...theyre similar in that they tend to have moodiness involved, impulsivity and self-damaging behaviors for compensatory measures. Otherwise, theyre not really that similar, but they do seem to \"like\" one another and often show up in the same person...making their lives chaotic, difficult, dysfunctional, and intense. So, if your friend is concerned that they may have one (or both) of these illnesses, they should not be ashamed. Its definitely not their fault. They should, instead, get help from a professional...and INSIST that they are treated appropriately with the correct types of therapy and medication.\n",
      "\n",

      "In addition, people with BPD quite often have a weak self concept. They dont always know who they really are deep down inside. They may always feel like theres something missing or something wrong with them intrinsically. This can cause periods of dissociation and difficulty in maintaining a healthy sense of self esteem. They may have a weak value system (or one that is missing entirely) or find that they have a difficult time adhering to whatever value system they do have. Since theres a real issue with trusting and black/white thinking, they dont always trust in their own decisions and may do things to get people to \"like\" them or not leave them that would be against their value system normally, and think that they (themselves) are terrible/bad/evil people for doing it later. They often take their mistakes in life much more seriously than other people. A \"normal\" person may make the same mistake and feel bad about it, but its unlikely that they will see themselves as terrible/bad/evil for having made the mistake. Oftentimes, a person with BPD would make that mistake and internalize it as a personal failure...that it happened because they (themselves) are awful/bad/wrong. This means that their self concept is much more fluid than \"normal\" people. Now, please keep in mind that not all BPD sufferers have every single one of these symptoms. There are definitely other symptoms that can be included in the diagnosis, but this is a pretty good start and the most common symptoms sufferers may face. People with BPD need intense therapy because they must change how they see themselves and the world around them (having a more mature, realistic viewpoint of the world that isnt all black or all white), rebuild value systems and self concepts that may be missing/aberrant, build the ability to trust others/self, and learn coping mechanisms. DBT (Dialectic Behavioral Therapy) was developed for BPD sufferers initially and has shown some positive results for sufferers who adhere to the techniques in their lives. Heres the thing, too. Its fairly common for Bipolar and BPD to be comorbid in a person (meaning they have both at the same time). We dont necessarily know if theres a genetic link between them, but we are beginning to think thats possible. A person suffering from both at the same time (untreated) would tend to be extremely emotional, moody, hypersensitive to criticism, untrusting, self-damaging, with highs and lows in behavior that make their lives (and the lives of those who love them) quite difficult. They are chaotic because their brain isnt working correctly due to chemical imbalances and, at the same time, their perception of themselves, other people and the world is one based on distrust and fear of being abandoned or rejected. They tend to have problems with love relationships, friendships, family relationships, and relationships with coworkers. Quite often, they end up being in the hospital for suicidal ideations or for mania (more often for depression than mania). Its not uncommon for them to end up in the system for some time before they get a proper and correct diagnosis (and a good treatment plan). They may get kicked out of the system early with a misdiagnosis which leads to poor management of symptoms and relapsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Borderline Personality Disorder, like all other personality disorders, is an abnormal way of perceiving and interacting with the world. Think of it as having a dirty filter that the sufferer sees the world through constantly. We do not believe it is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, but its possible that some of the symptoms might because medication *can* help some sufferers (but doesnt help everyone). Because they perceive things incorrectly, they often react inappropriately to situations that occur. People with BPD typically (not always as there is some room for deviation) have problems with emotional regulation and may react incorrectly to unexpected situations that occur. They may be perceived by others as being moody and reactive. They often have problems with trusting other people. Its believed this occurs because of unhealthy childhood experiences with parents, caregivers, teachers, and peers. However, there may also be a genetic propensity for people to have BPD as well. Regardless, they tend to have short-lived, intense relationships with lovers where they cling one minute and push away the next. They often have issues with infidelity due to a fear that they will be abandoned. Theres a real fear of abandonment and rejection. They tend to have black and white thinking (things are all wrong or all good) and that means they often either idealize or villainize their lovers, depending on their mood. This leaves the lover often feelling like they dont really know whats going on or where they stand in the relationship. One minute, the lover is being adored and the next, they are being pushed away. If theres infidelity or other types of self-damaging, risky behavior occurring, the lover may eventually get fed up. Because of this behavior and their intense lack of trust, quite often...the sufferer does cause their lover to leave them. This, of course, reinforces their belief that they will always be abandoned, left, and/or alone...and the cycle of clinging/pushing away starts again with a new person usually quite soon afterward. It should be noted...This black and white thinking tends to color their perception and behavior in regards to themselves, their self esteem, their self concept, and the world around them. Quite often, they are hypersensitive to criticism (or even perceived criticism). This goes back to that deep seeded fear of being rejected or abandoned. More than likely, they lived in a household situation with a parent or caregiver who would...one minute seemingly dote on the child and the next, without obvious reason...push the child away. Inconsistent, inattentive, cold, neglectful or absentee parenting seems to be a big part of the reason a person with BPD MAY have had it develop. Since we learn to trust from the first people in our lives (usually, our parents)....if a parent proves to be untrustworthy, absent, cold, or inconsistent with affection/punishment...a child may learn that they cant trust anyone. Deep down, people with BPD dont always trust themselves, either. Because they tend to have very black and white thinking, they dont always handle situations very well. This \"just world\" concept where they seem to think that \"good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people\" can cause them to see themselves as bad/evil/wrong if something bad happens to them, even things they cant control. In addition, they often have feelings of intense anger if things dont go as they expected, especially if it deals with other people. Their expectations of other people are usually unrealistic (because their expectations of themselves and the world are unrealistic generally.) They may get physically violent or abusive when things dont go the way they expected. During a period of devaluation of their love partner, they may become violent or abusive (note: this doesnt happen with every BPD sufferer, but it is a common enough occurrence that it should be said). They have intense changes in feelings and react quickly to situations without always thinking things through. They can be self-damaging and impulsive. This is where people get it confused with Bipolar disease because Bipolar tends to cause highs and lows and emotional reactivity during those periods. People with BPD have this issue all the time, however...not just when they are experiencing a disease relapse from one extreme or the other.\n",

      "Well think of bipolar as a rollar coaster you have high and low peaks where your mood can either rapidly alternate up and down or have the longwr lasting shifts. Ups that last for days ect. Depression and anger are two of the most common. Now as for borderline personality , its more like a tilt a wirl. Your moods can go secerap directions and rapidly , impulsivness is a major part of it as well. Not making sound judgement and just doing. Not to mention reations to situations that are commonly deemed inappropriate. I myself suffer from both. And it took me along time to become stable. And somedays i still struggle with it.\n",

Im too frightened every time I try. So its not working death wont work its not our time. So what did I love? I love the world and I want to be a part of its healing. It doesnt matter if people understand its enough that I do and the very few who know and love me understand, the rest dont matter.
